# SQL_queries_movies
## About
This repository contains a range of SQL queries generated for a movie rental company's database of inventory, customers and rental transactions.

## Objective
A video company is preparing for a pivot to streaming. To inform the company's business strategy, the business intelligence team requested data analysis and answers to ad-hoc questions about its inventory and customer base. I used SQL to query the database for these answers, using techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), table joins, data-filtering and subqueries.

## Data
The dataset contains 15 tables holding information about:
  -Movie inventory, including titles, actors, descriptions and release information
  -Customers, including location and rental history
  -Rental transactions, including timing and payment information
  -Stores, including transactions and locations

The sample database is from PostgreSQLTutorial.com. See more information about the database [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).


## Tableau analysis
I created Tableau visualizations to illustrate the results of some of my SQL queries. View these on my [Tableau Public page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacquelyn.marmaduke/viz/SQLVisualizations/topcustomers?publish=yes).
